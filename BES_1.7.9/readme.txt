"BES – Battle Encoder Shirasé" - Free/Libre (Open-Source) Software that controls per-process CPU usage, released under the GNU General Public License. Portable (installation not needed).

BES is a small tool that throttles the CPU usage of the process you “target”: for instance, you can limit the CPU usage of a process which would use CPU 100%, down to 50% (or any percentage you’d like). With this, you can use other programs comfortably while doing something CPU-intensive in the background. For more than 10 years, BES has also helped various gamers as a handy “anti-freeze” agent, though that was not the original purpose of BES.
